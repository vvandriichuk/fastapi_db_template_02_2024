This my current vision of the FastAPI structure.

Short description of this structure and changes:

v.2.0.0 - Unit of Work:
- Added transaction manager to handle the database transactions

v.1.0.0 - Onion Architecture:

- Take beyond the logic from the API endpoints and put it in the middle layer
- Added SQLAlchemy models and linked them with Pydantic schemas through to_read_model
- Changed orm_mode for schemas class Config to from_attributes (for Pydantic v2)
- Added Service layer to handle the logic of the API endpoints
- Added Repository layer to handle the logic of the database (based on dependency inversion principle from SOLID principles)

TODO:

- Add tests
- Add abstract class to choose DB
- Add PostgreSQL database
- Add logger
